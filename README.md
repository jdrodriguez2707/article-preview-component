## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- A little JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Font library
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - Image library

### What I learned

How to cut images with the `clip-path` property:

```css
.article-preview__image {
  clip-path: inset(0 0 50px 0);
}
```

### Continued development

- Manage frustration
- Design more orderly by breaking down large problems into smaller problems and trying to finish each part before moving on to the next
- Learn and practice more about DOM manipulation

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - It was always like my co-worker and I was able to ask for help when I needed it
- [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - This helped me check the markup validity in my HTML document.
- [The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - This helped me validate my CSS style sheet.
- [CSSmatic](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me add shadow to the article preview component and the share section active.
